# aaucns_rio
This software contains an implementation of Radar-Inertial Odometry using multi-state EKF and factor graphs.

# Compilation
`catkin_make --force-cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={Release, Debug}`.

`--force-cmake` is there only to force copying the yaml config file into the
`~/.ros` folder. If you copy it manually you do not need that option.

# Use
The software can be used either as a ROS node or to replay ROS bag files.
For the latter, modify the file in `nodes/rio_(fg)_replay_node.cpp` by giving the
bag filename (file must be in `~/.ros`) and modify the topic names. Acronym `fg` stands for "factor graph".
The default version uses EKF as the estimation backbone.

Within `src/rio_(fg)_replay.cpp` you might also have to modify the message types.

Then, run the software using one of the launch files in the `launch/` folder.

RIO estimator must be configured through a yaml config file. An example is in `config/` folder.
The software reads this config from the `~/.ros` folder (or your alternative ROS runtine folder if you changed it). 

# Dependencies

Users are expected to have Eigen, PCL and GTSAM installed system-wide.

# Example dataset

You can download [here](https://cns-data.aau.at/rio_dataset/awr_6.bag) and [here](https://cns-data.aau.at/rio_dataset/awr_7.bag) example bagfiles to use with the rio.
Remember to place them in your `~/.ros` folder.

# Notes
Radar data is assumed to be 4D point clouds. By default, the current version uses the `XYZI` point cloud type from `PCL`, in
which `data[0-2]` are the `xyz` coordinates of points and `data[3]` is the Doppler velocity, `intensity` is the reflection intensity.
If you use `TI AWR1843BOOST` sensor then you can use this -> `https://github.com/janmichl/ti_mmwave_rospkg` fork of the driver which outputs consistent pointclouds. 

It is planned to interface the software with a dedicated radar `PCL` type.
