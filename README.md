# aaucns_rio
MultiState-EKF Radar-Inertial Odometry

# Compilation
catkin_make --force-cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={Release, Debug}

`--force-cmake` is there only to force copying the yaml config file into the
`.ros` folder. If you copy it manually you do not need that option.

# Use
The software can be used wither as a ROS node or to replay ROS bag files.
For the latter, modify the file in `nodes/rio_(fg)_replay_node.cpp` by giving the
bag filename (file must be in `.ros) and modify the topic names.

Within `src/rio_(fg)_replay.cpp` you might also have to modify the message types.

Then, run the software using one of the launch files in the `launch/` folder.

# Dependencies

Users are expected to have Eigen, PCL and GTSAM installed system-wide.
